#Marvel Test

What I used and why...
-------------

I chose to create this solution using .NET (Xamarin Studio, because I'm on a Mac), basicaly because it is where I feel more confortable when it's not a mobile solution. Though I've considered to use Ruby or plain HTML using some JS framework.

How to run it...
-----------

I've developed it with Xamarin Studio, it should build in a Windows environment as well.

  1- Clone this repository
  2- Open Avidity.MarvelTest.sln (Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio)
  3- Restore Packages of the solution, do not Update, just restore them.
  4- Run it

Considerations
--------

- I really enjoyed myself doing this test, and I'm sorry about the delay and reschedules, but it is not something that you have to worry about, I am really commited to work.
- There are some things that I would like to think a little bit more and maybe I could come with a better solution with its architecture.
- I took liberty to use partially the CSS of Avidity's website, basically Fonts and also I wanted to keep it simple. Although, for something involving Marvel universe I would love to create something "shiny"
- I tryed to publish it with AppHarbor in case you wanted to see it live, but for some reason it builded the solution but no page was published, and I had no time to figure out what happened :(
